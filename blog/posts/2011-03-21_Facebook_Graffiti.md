I don't know if anyone remembers Facebook early on when people covered their
profiles with application widgets.
One of those applications was Graffiti.
A lot of people had it, and I loved surprising people with high quality graffiti
on their wall.
I drew all sorts of things, usually related to the random victim.
I almost entirely drew from reference, looking at what I am drawing.

Without further ado, here they are in a *chronologically ascending order*:

Admittedly, they start out pretty bad. But I promise they get better. So much better.

![A 2007 iPhone](./images/graffiti_iphone.png)

I drew this depiction of the [first iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(original)) for Jon.
He loves his Apple products.
I am still not a fan of Apple.

![Cartel Album Cover](./images/graffiti_cartel.png)

I drew this for Rex before Cartel released their [self-titled album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel_(Cartel_album)).
He didn't know what it was and I had to tell him.

![Where Have All the MerryMakers Gone? album cover](./images/graffiti_harvey_danger.png)

This is a depiction of Harvey Danger's album [Where Have All the Merrymakers Gone?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Have_All_the_Merrymakers_Gone%3F).
I actually met a friend of mine, Allison, via this song.
Back when Facebook was a garbage dump of applications,
one application allowed the user to upload a song so people can play it on your profile.
Allison and I were both friends of Amanda and we both uploaded this song to our profiles.
So Amanda told us both and I sent her a message on Facebook and eventually we became really good friends.
I don't remember what the cotton candy is about. =\

![death by gun](./images/graffiti_death.png)

This is the first of a series of my friends and I drawing each other dying in various ways.
This one depicts Jake shooting himself on a gradiented hill and gradiented sky lit up by a gradiented sun.
I guess I discovered gradients were easy at this point.

![Senses Fail Let it Unfold You album cover](./images/graffiti_senses_fail.png)

I drew this one for Allison because we were about to go to a Senses Fails concert at Headliners in Louisville, KY.
It is a depiction of [Let it Enfold You](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Enfold_You).
I loved Senses Fails so much.

![death by grenade](./images/graffiti_grenade.png)

Watch out Jake! That grenade is going to kill you as you burn to death!

![Excel Saga's Menchi](./images/graffiti_menchi_excel_sage.png)

Here is the dog [Menchi (メンチ)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Excel_Saga_characters#Menchi)
from [Excel Saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excel_Saga).
Trust me, it is a dog and not a cat.
I drew this for Sarah.
I had just met her at this point at a LAN party at either Garrett's house or Garrett's cousin's house.
I believe she was actually sad about something at the time and I drew this to cheer her up.

![death by car](./images/graffiti_car_death.png)

Now Jon and I were having at each other in graffiti death. As you see, the person driving the car, me, swerved around the dog to hit the object of less value, Jon himself.

![chex mix](./images/graffiti_chex_mix.png)

This was a drawing for Mandy. I don't remember the joke behind [Chex Mix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix),
but there was a joke here.
I had just met her during the Summer.
I don't remember if we met in the math office or at a local concert.

![planet](./images/graffiti_world.png)

I had a thing for Mandy and drew a picture with a flattering phrase in Spanish.
It reads, "You are the hottest in the world!"

![bunny](./images/graffiti_bunny.png)

Nothing special here. Just a cute drawing of a bunny for Mandy.

Mandy was sick at the time so I drew this to cheer her up.
[The cat](./images/graffiti_azumanga_daioh.png) is from [Azumanga Daioh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azumanga_Daioh).
The Japanese reads, "Bad cat."

![penguin](./images/graffiti_penguin.png)

I believe this was for Darrah on a random request. A penguin.

![Yellowcard Paper Walls album cover](./images/graffiti_yellowcard.png)

I believe this was for Darrah again, but this is when I started getting serious about detail.
Yellowcard announced their new album [Paper Walls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Walls) and I was excited about it.
I'm not entirely sure what I drew here because it doesn't match the album cover.
I either drew an early rendition of the cover or I took a lot of liberty improvising.

I remember when it first leaked to the internet and I quickly downloaded it and
listened to it during my internship doing spectral analysis in Ferdinand, IN.
It was a really good album then and is still a really good album.

![whale breaching](./images/graffiti_whale.png)

This was for one of my best friends, Jay.
A humpback whale breeching.
I guess we took a little too much privilege in poking fun at his weight.
But we always used to tell him to [breach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_surfacing_behaviour#Breaching.2C_lunging.2C_and_porpoising)
in the pool and he was a good spirit about it.
He has actually lost a lot of weight since then.

![giraffe](./images/graffiti_giraffe.png)

This giraffe was for my friend Amanda. Giraffes are her favorite animal.
I still never fail to send her any comics that come up that include giraffes to her.
I believe she has said her dream house involves many giraffes in the yard.

![river](./images/graffiti_river.png)

I drew this for Grant.
I don't remember what I was trying to do.
I think it was a river in a desert, but ended up looking like a flag.

![audioslave album cover](./images/graffiti_audioslave.png)

My friend Noah, being a good skeptic, was not convinced I was drawing these by hand.
So he challenged me to draw one in front of him.
I looked through my album covers and chose this [self-titled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audioslave_(album))
album by Audio Slave, a band we both enjoy.
I drew it on his wall and he watched me do it, stroke by stroke to his amazement.
Damn that felt good.

![apple](./images/graffiti_apple.png)

This apple with a grammatical breakdown was for Rebekah,
a girl I met at a party at Allison's house and now goes to Purdue.
We watched [The Shining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)) at that party.
Rebekah and I got into a disagreement about the [purpose color words](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/red)
have in English.
I don't remember what all was said, but I think my English breakdown here is a little fishy.
The apple isn't though, it looks delicious.

![Amber Pacific The Possibility and the Promise album cover](./images/graffiti_amber_pacific.png)

This was for the random victim Anna.
I had to do a scavenger hunt for the album since I could not remember what it was.
I kept searching for albums with the word "Ace" in it.
But alas, going through my [last.fm library](http://www.last.fm/user/ceramic_spider/library)
page by page finally found it.
Luckily it was in the "A" section.
[The Possibility and the Promise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Possibility_and_the_Promise) by Amber Pacific.

![Jimmy Eat World Stay on My Side Tonight album cover](./images/graffiti_jimmy_eat_world.png)

This melodramatic piece is for my friend Jessica, an avid Jimmy Eat World fan.
The album is an EP: [Stay on My Side Tonight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_on_My_Side_Tonight).
Let it be known, Jessica is no Hitler.
She loves the JEW.

![Brand New Deja Entendu](./images/graffiti_brand_new.png)

This one went to Noah.
A depiction of Brand New's [Deja Entendu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deja_Entendu).
I just wanted to draw an album cover of an album I really liked.

![Kirby](./images/graffiti_kirby.png)

This one went to my good friend Adam. He was a Nintendo fan boy. But, everyone loves Nintendo.

![batman](./images/graffiti_batman.png)

This was for a Louisville friend of mine, Brooke.
She is a fan of Batman, but I think she is more a fan of the classic Batman.
But, since I am a fan of the [new Batman](http://cache2.allpostersimages.com/p/LRG/18/1856/KOH8D00Z/posters/batman-begins.jpg),
I drew her the new batman.
I remember my brother joking about how his knee looked like an erection.

On an aside, I remember Brooke telling me she met a girl at her university at
Louisville and their introduction dialog with each other was about how they both
discovered they both knew me.
I felt so popular.

![star wars](./images/graffiti_star_wars.png)

This was for the random victim Gregg.
I don't really know Gregg, but I knew enough to know he loves Star Wars.
Which I too am a huge fan of.
This is the epic [opening scene of episode IV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z33-qOXOWS4&feature=related).
I sure hope he appreciated the random gift.

![transformers movie](./images/graffiti_transformers.png)

This was for Allison before the first new Transformers movie came out.
This is Optimus Prime as he shows up in the [promotional posters](http://www.ilovesubstance.com/images/movies/transformers_movie_poster_optimus_prime.jpg).
The movie sucked.

![Thunderstorm](./images/graffiti_thunderstorm.png)

I drew this for Katelynn. We had a joke about thunderstorms.
I won't go into any details on that one.

![Zelda Link](./images/graffiti_zelda_link.png)

Once again, a Nintendo character drawing for Adam.
This one is [Link](http://images.wikia.com/zelda/images/9/99/Link_Wind_Waker_11.png) from Zelda: Wind Waker,
possibly my favorite Zelda game.
I know, you hate the cell-shading, but those of us that don't, think it is the most fun one.

![Collective Soul Youth album cover](./images/graffiti_collective_soul.png)

I drew this for the random victim Kami.
I met her in the math office in high school.
She was taking a make-up exam when I was goofing off in there.
Kami and I actually talked quite a bit.
She was a really cute girl.
This one is an album cover for Collective Soul's [Youth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_(Collective_Soul_album)).

![300 the movie](./images/graffiti_300.png)

This was for Jake.
I think he drew a scene from 300 so I drew [one back](http://manhattaninfidel.com/__oneclick_uploads/2010/12/300_movie.jpg).
I'm actually quite enthused by how well I did on his face.

![Ninja Gaiden](./images/graffiti_ninja.png)

This was the last one.
It was for Jay.
He drew a picture of himself as a ninja and me as a pirate getting killed by his ninja star.
That wasn't the first drawing of a depiction of us as pirates and ninjas where ninjas are kicking ass,
but I retaliated this time with a sweet picture of the ninja from [Ninja Gaiden](http://th04.deviantart.net/fs26/PRE/f/2008/150/7/5/Ninja_Gaiden_Wallpaper_by_igotgame1075.jpg).
Not the best way to retaliate.
Oh, and I thought the game sucked.
